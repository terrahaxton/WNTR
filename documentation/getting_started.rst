Getting started
======================================

To start using WNTR, open a Python console and import the package::

	import wntr	

WNTR comes with a simple `getting started example <https://github.com/USEPA/WNTR/blob/master/examples/getting_started.py>`_, shown below.
This example demonstrates how to:

* Import WNTR
* Generate a water network model 
* Simulate hydraulics
* Plot simulation results on the network

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/getting_started.py

Additional examples are included throughout the WNTR documentation.

Several EPANET INP files and example files are also included in the WNTR repository in the `examples folder <https://github.com/USEPA/WNTR/blob/master/examples>`_.
Example networks range from a simple 9 node network to a 3,000 node network.
Additional network models can be downloaded from the University of Kentucky
